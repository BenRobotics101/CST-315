# Paging and Memory Assignment

By Benjamin Carter and Trevor Pope.

--- 

To build, use `make`. The executable will be called `run`.

It will take in the data from `logMem.txt`, populate the logical memory, use a page table, and then populate the physical memory.
It will then output the result into `outfile.txt`.

Note:
- logMem must be at least 4 lines, each with a carriage return.
